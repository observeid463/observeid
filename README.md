Lack of identity, credentials, access and password management
Concerns about identity and access top the minds of professionals, according to the CSA report. "Access topped the list this year because it's where data protection begins and it ends," Yeo says.

Key findings about access and identity management in the report include:

Enhanced security at the root of the enterprise architecture has shifted hacker attacks toward end-user identification, which is easy prey.
Discrete isolation of users and applications is required to achieve a robust zero-trust layer for easy authentication.
Complicated tools are the only part of such a story as infrastructure rights management (CIEM). Operational policies and structured risk are also essential.
Trust is more than handing out passwords and codes. It is earned. User facilities need a risk assessment that dynamically reflects business requirements.
Authentication bypass
The problem of data leakage is often the result of neglecting the authentication mechanisms used. This can include the use of weak passwords, unreliable certificates, untested encryption keys, etc. Another possible problem is the management of permissions and access rights. That is, many users are given far more permissions than needed. This leads to possible leaks and can result in compromised data. What will it take to eliminate the threat? If you're running multiple clouds at once, you need a comprehensive access rights management solution. One such solution is <a href="https://www.observeid.com/">https://www.observeid.com/</a>

Identity theft
Phishing can also pose a threat to cloud infrastructure. Exploits, manipulation of transactions and data modifications should also be included in this category. Attackers often see the cloud as the best place to perform such attacks. Therefore, it is recommended to block the transfer of accounts between users and configure the use of multifactor authentication. In addition, control over accounts and accounts is often applied.
